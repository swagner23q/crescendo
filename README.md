## Description
_The task at hand was to create a project within a four day span working in a new group with back and front end developers. We decided to use our newly acquired PHP and CSS skills to create a mock eCommerce site. We aimed to have functionality like creating user accounts, ability to log in / out, add items to a shopping cart, go through a checkout process, and have emails be sent to the user upon registration and order completion. We were able to achieve these goals within our time limit, and Sara made it look amazing!_

## Required Technology to see this app in action
* _Git_
* _PHP_
* _MySQL_
* _phpMyAdmin (suggested)_
* _Composer_
* _A sense of humor_

## Steps for Setup
* _*Heroku setup still in progress as of 3/11/16, follow the instructions below for now:_
* _Verify that PHP 5.6+ is installed on your machine_
* _Open your preferred method of accessing Git (like a terminal window)_
* _Clone the repo with the following command:_

## Database Setup
_A zip version of the required database has been included in this repository. It was created following the instructions found here:_ https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/php/database-basics-with-php/exporting-mysql-databases-in-phpmyadmin

* _DB creation statements are also included in the repository, they are found at root/db/db-sql-create-statements.sql_

## Note About Tests

* INSERT INTO `product_types` (type) VALUES ("shirt"), ("pants"), ("shoes"), ("jacket"), ("beanies");
